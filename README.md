# DDD Persistence Experiments

Today I stumbled upon [this repository](https://github.com/pierregillon/Aggregate.Persistence.Patterns), which contains
example C# code for a couple of aggregate persistence patterns. The author has written a couple of blog articles (in
French) about them on his website, and some docs in English in the repository.

The State-Snapshot pattern somehow stood out for me, and I decided to do a little experiment and implement the pattern
in a little Spring Boot application written in Kotlin.

This is the result so far.
